# WinForm-CRUD-API-UnitTest-Async
A Complete Windows Form Application For CRUD Operation By Using an API

I developed this application for CRUD operation by using an API. 

I developed this windows form application in C# for managing Employees details. User can  add, edit, remove, view and search and export (CSV or Tab separated) Employee details. Employed details can be exposed through RESTful service. 

In this project Repository pattern is applied.<br/>
Data Concurrency approach is adapted. <br/>
Unit Tests for the methods are developed.<br/>
Many functions are provided in the project.
- Post Employee Details
- Edit Employee Details
- Delete Employee Details
- Search Employee Details
- Get All Employees Details
- Export Employees Detail to Excel sheet 
- etc.
